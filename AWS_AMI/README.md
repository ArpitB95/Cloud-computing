## Amazon machine image (AMI)
 - An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance.
 - You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you require multiple instances with the same    configuration.

- AMI is created to launch multiple instance from it.
- During the holiday period, it is advisable to run an AMI of an instance as it costs less than actual instance.
- AMI is basically a carbon copy of the instance it created from.
